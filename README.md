# Scenario-Based Java Interview Questions Solved Using Stream API

This repository contains a curated collection of **scenario-based Java interview problems**, each solved using the **Stream API**, **Java Collections**, and **OOP principles**. The problems are structured around real-world systems to demonstrate practical use cases and help Java backend developers prepare effectively for technical interviews.

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each sub-folder under the `STC/` directory represents a self-contained mini-project or domain model:

| Module/Folders | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `library_Management_System` | Book filtering, issue tracking, overdue listings using Stream API |
| `Online_Shopping_Cart_System` | Cart operations including total calculation, discount application, and product filtering |
| `oop_design_oriented_scenarios_Banking_Management_System` | Bank account management, customer analytics, sorting/filtering via streams |
| `oop_design_oriented_scenarios_Library_Management_System` | Library system modeled with OOP and enhanced with stream-based operations |
| `Student_Management_System` | Student grading, pass/fail filtering, subject-wise grouping, and more |

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- Java 21 (JavaSE-21)
- Stream API
- Collections Framework
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Eclipse IDE

---

## üéØ Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- Help Java developers practice **Stream API and OOP** concepts in an applied, interview-oriented manner
- Simulate **real-world system design and problem-solving** scenarios
- Improve **code quality, readability, and modularity**

---

## üß† Sample Problems Covered

- Filter overdue library books using `filter()`
- Sort customers by account balance using `sorted()`
- Group students by subject or grade using `collect(Collectors.groupingBy(...))`
- Calculate total cart value with custom discount logic
- Count how many students passed using `count()` and `filter()`

---

## üõ† How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Import into **Eclipse IDE**
3. Ensure JavaSE-21 is selected under **JRE System Library**
4. Run the `main()` class inside any scenario to see it in action
